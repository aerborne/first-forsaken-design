        <h2 class="title">My Story</h2>
        <p>I am the only child of Danilo and Virginia Zantua. I’m “Danica Timeña Zantua” to my family, “Cai” to my cousins, relatives and to my close friends.
        “Nica” to those who know me. I am turning 20 years old this November 23, 2017 and I was born at Quezon Memorial Hospital, Lucena City. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this is the fifth time that I will celebrate my birthday without my father because he died last May 15, 2013 while my mother I grew with left us when I was 6 years old only.</p>
        <p>But life must go on. I have to be strong. I am now in the care of my auntie, who is also my guardian, Marina Zantua Magnaye. I called her “Tita Mar” and she is my father’s sister. She is a single mother.
        She has four children and one of them supports us from our financial needs.</p>
        <p>We are now live at 115 Sto. Tomas St. Santolan, Pasig City.
        We are 8 persons living in our house and we are lucky that there's a person who is helping us. To return it, I’m studying well, to finish it and to have a good and stable job or business in the future. I will help the family I grew with because I really don’t know how long my cousin will help us since she has also her own family.</p>
        <p>When I was in Elementary, I graduated at Bacood Elementary School and my most unforgettable moment in Primary days was that, I proclaimed to my teacher and
        classmates that I am an adopted child only and when I was in High   School, I graduated at Santolan High School and my greatest achievement in High School days was that, I have overcome my father’s death and graduated top 2.</p>
        <p>Santolan High School has a big part for me as an individual. My principles and dreams created there. Aside from many new learnings, I’ve learned also how to socialize and to treat people accordingly.
        To socialized to the people who helped me to develop my personality such as my family, relatives, friends, bestfriends, classmates, teachers and more importantly, God.</p>
        <p>It’s nice to think that I have come this way. From a childish, rebels and a  naughty girl, I have grown to be a lady. A lady that wants good for everyone and especially to my family.
        I have many dreams that sometimes people think it’s far from reality and I believe that, It doesn’t need to be a leader to serve but the sincerity in service matters most.</p>
        <p>I’m a trustworthy person, a friend that always there for you in times of good and bad. Even I’m easily gets mad, gets jealous, gets mean and gets cry, I am not too long to forgive and forget but in times that my family is talking about or involve, I can forget our connections, even for my own sake just to fight for them.</p>
        <p>And as an individual, I give importance to time, orderliness and cleanliness even it’s not obvious. Again, my family, people around me and only God builds my world and my whole personality.</p>
